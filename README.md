## Introduction to Python for Asset Pricing / Financial Economics

This repository contains Python files that I have created for a Master's course in **Asset Pricing / Financial Economics**.

The goal is to introduce students to the Python programming language, with a focus on **basic data analysis** and **financial economics applications**.

It is recommended to work through the files in the following order:
1. **introduction.py** (Introduction to Python, Pandas, and NumPy)
2. **yfinance.py** (Yahoo finance package for financial data, Intorduction to dictionaries)
3. **regressions.py** (Financial data cleaning, Realized Variance and GARCH, CAPM, Fama-French factor model)
4. **time_series_analysis.py** (Testing for stationarity, Forecasting with ARIMA model) - 'portfolio.csv' dataset is used here
5. **regularization.py** (Regularization techniques: Ridge, Lasso)

     Companion slides for this script can be found [here](https://github.com/ajda-marjanovic/Intro-to-Python-for-Asset-Pricing/blob/d63b2bb1582943fcb03edc54d19621caa971e140/Regularization.pdf)
   
Make sure you have these **libraries** installed:
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- yfinance
- arch
- pandas_datareader
- statsmodels
- sklearn
