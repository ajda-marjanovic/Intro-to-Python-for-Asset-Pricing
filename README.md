## Introduction to Python for Asset Pricing / Financial Economics

This repository contains Python files that I have created for a Master's course in **Asset Pricing / Financial Economics**.

The goal is to introduce students to the Python programming language, with a focus on **basic data analysis** and **financial economics applications**.

It is recommended to work through the files in the following order:
1. **introduction.py** (Introduction to Python, Pandas, and NumPy)
2. **yfinance.py** (Yahoo finance package for financial data, Intorduction to dictionaries)
3. **regressions.py** (Financial data cleaning, Variance, CAPM, Fama-French factor model)

Make sure you have these **libraries** installed:
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- yfinance
- arch
- pandas_datareader
- statsmodels
